            <p>
                We are a group of Hazara students at George Brown College who have come together to form the <strong>HSA Association</strong>.
                Our goal is to build a supportive and inclusive community that represents our identity, culture, and values on campus.
                <br><br>
                Through this association, we aim to organize a wide range of cultural, educational, and social programs that not only bring our community closer but also share the beauty of our heritage with others.
                From cultural nights and language workshops to community gatherings and collaborative events — we are excited to create meaningful experiences for everyone.
